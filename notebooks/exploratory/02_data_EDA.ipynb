    "### Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Calculate **basic statistics** like **mean, median, and standard deviation** for the 'Rating,' 'Aroma,' 'Acidity,' 'Body,' 'Flavor,' 'Aftertaste,' and 'Price' columns to get an overall understanding of the dataset. Find out how often different roasters and locations appear in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributions:\n",
    "Visualize the **distributions** of 'Rating,' 'Aroma,' 'Acidity,' 'Body,' 'Flavor,' and 'Aftertaste' using to understand the spread of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlations:\n",
    "Investigate the **correlations** between different attributes such as 'Rating,' 'Aroma,' 'Acidity,' 'Body,' 'Flavor,' and 'Aftertaste.' Identify which attributes tend to go together or have an impact on the overall rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top Roasters and Coffees:\n",
    "Identify the top-rated roasters and coffee names based on the 'Rating' column. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantity Analysis:\n",
    "Investigate the 'Quantity' and 'Unit' columns to understand the different packaging sizes and units in which coffee is sold. Analyze how these factors relate to pricing and consumer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roaster Performance:\n",
    "Evaluate roasters' performance based on their ratings and the origin of the coffee beans. Are there specific regions or origins associated with higher ratings for particular roasters?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deeper Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geospatial Analysis:\n",
    "Analyze the 'Roaster_Location' and 'Origin' columns to understand where the roasters are located and where the coffee beans are sourced from. You can use geospatial tools to create maps or investigate the relationship between origin and rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Currency Analysis:\n",
    "Analyze the 'Currency' column to understand the currencies used for pricing. You can convert prices to a common currency (e.g., USD) for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Analysis:\n",
    "Analyze the relationship between 'Price' and 'Rating.' Do higher-priced coffees tend to have higher ratings? You can also look for outliers in pricing.Investigate the relationship between pricing ('Price' and 'Currency') and sensory attributes ('Aroma,' 'Acidity,' 'Body,' 'Flavor,' 'Aftertaste'). Are there pricing strategies associated with higher ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Analysis:\n",
    "Perform natural language processing (NLP) on the 'Review_Description,' 'Blind_Assessment,' and 'Notes' columns to extract insights about the sensory descriptions, flavor profiles, and unique characteristics of the coffees."
